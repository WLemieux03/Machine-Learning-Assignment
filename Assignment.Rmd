## Introduction
Using data from accelerometers worn by exercise enthusiasts, we aim to develop a model predicting if an exercise was perfomed correctly, or incorrectly. Five states were identified: a correct state (A) and four types of error in the movement (B to E). 

## Data loading

The data is downloaded if not already present in the working directory, and each set is loaded to a dataframe in the memory. 
```{r}
if(!file.exists("pml-training.csv")){
        download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "pml-training.csv", "auto")
}
if(!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")){
        download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "pml-testing.csv", "auto")
}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```


## Data cleaning
The data is checked for missing values per column:
```{r}
colNA<-colSums(is.na(training)|training=="")
sumColNA<-sum(colNA > 0)
rowNA<-rowSums(is.na(training)|training=="")
```
And it can be seen that among the `{r} length(colnames)` variables in the table, `{r} sumColNA` have missing values (`{r} unique(colNA[colNA>0,])`/`{r} length(colNA)`). Moreover, the points missing values all miss `{r} unique(rowNA[rowNA>0,])` variables. These variables are unreliable to perform prediction since they are missing in so many cases. They cannot be used for the analysis and are removed:
```{r}
training<-training[,colNA==0]
testing<-testing[,colNA==0]
```

The variables refering to the belt, arm (and forearm) and dumbell are further subsetted. 
```{r}
subset <- grepl("belt|arm|dumbell|classe", names(training))
training<-training[,subset]
testing<-testing[,subset]
```

## Model fitting
The data is split and 10% is fitted on a random forest model. The out of ample error is evaluated on the validation dataset (remaining 90%). Only 10% is used to build the model for computational limitations. 
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(13313)
inTrain <‐ createDataPartition(y=training$classe,p=0.1, list=FALSE)
train <- training[inTrain,]
validate <- training[-inTrain,]

trCtl <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
mod <- train(classe~., method="rf", data=train, trControl=trCtl)
predTrain <- predict(mod, train)
confusionMatrix(predTrain, train$classe)
```
The in sample accuracy is calculated as 100%,

The out sample error is calculated on the validation data set.
```{r}
predVal <- predict(mod, validate)
confusionMatrix(predVal, validate$classe)
```
The out sample accuracy is of 92.2%, which is close to 100 and is acceptable, even if it could be better. 

## Prediction 
The test dataset is predicted using the random forest model. 
```{r}
predTest <- predict(mod, testing)
predTest
```

## Conclusion
It was possible to predict the test classe of error. The out sample accuracy is estimated as 92.2%.
